## You Are Operating Under GAAI Governance

This project uses GAAI (`.gaai/` folder). Read `.gaai/core/GAAI.md` for orientation.

## Agent Roles

Activate based on context:

**Discovery Agent** (`.gaai/core/agents/discovery.agent.md`)
→ Use when: clarifying intent, creating PRDs, Epics, Stories

**Delivery Agent** (`.gaai/core/agents/delivery.agent.md`)
→ Use when: implementing Stories from the validated backlog

**Bootstrap Agent** (`.gaai/core/agents/bootstrap.agent.md`)
→ Use when: first setup on an existing codebase, or refreshing project context

## Rules

**Read `.gaai/core/contexts/rules/base.rules.md` at the start of every session.** These are the universal governance rules (backlog-first, skill-first, memory discipline, backlog state lifecycle, archiving rules, forbidden patterns, default deny, conflict protocol).

For flow-specific rules (agent responsibilities, context isolation, branch rules, cron, capability readiness): `.gaai/core/contexts/rules/orchestration.rules.md`
