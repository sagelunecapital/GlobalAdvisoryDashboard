# GAAI — Quick Reference

## Slash Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/gaai-bootstrap` | Scan codebase, extract decisions, build memory files |
| `/gaai-discover` | Start Discovery — clarify intent, create Stories with acceptance criteria |
| `/gaai-deliver` | Start the Delivery Daemon — deliver refined Stories autonomously via tmux |
| `/gaai-status` | Show current backlog state and memory summary |

> `/gaai-deliver` and `/gaai-daemon` are aliases — both launch the same daemon.

## Starting a Session

1. Run `/gaai-discover` and describe what you want to build
2. Discovery creates a Story with acceptance criteria and adds it to the backlog
3. Run `/gaai-deliver` — starts the daemon, which delivers Stories autonomously in tmux

## Adding a Feature

1. `/gaai-discover` — "I want to add [feature description]"
2. Answer Discovery's clarifying questions until the Story is `refined`
3. `/gaai-deliver` — daemon picks up the Story and delivers it in an isolated tmux session

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.gaai/project/contexts/backlog/active.backlog.yaml` | What's authorized for execution |
| `.gaai/project/contexts/memory/project/context.md` | What the agent knows about your project |
| `.gaai/project/contexts/memory/decisions/_log.md` | Decisions that persist across sessions |
| `.gaai/core/GAAI.md` | Full framework orientation |

## Core Rules

Nothing gets built that isn't in the backlog. Discovery decides *what*. Delivery decides *how*. You decide *when*.

**Discovery Session Brief** — When Discovery delegates to sub-agents, it passes a structured brief capturing all session intelligence (decisions, observations, hypotheses, trade-offs, scope boundaries, constraints, qualitative preferences). Sub-agents cannot change or reinterpret these items. See [`agents/discovery.agent.md`](agents/discovery.agent.md) §Mandatory Sub-Agent Delegation Protocol.

## Daemon Options

```
/gaai-deliver                          # start (default: 1 slot) + open monitor
/gaai-deliver --max-concurrent 3       # 3 parallel deliveries
/gaai-deliver --status                 # live monitoring dashboard
/gaai-deliver --stop                   # graceful shutdown
```

One-time setup: `bash .gaai/core/scripts/daemon-setup.sh`
