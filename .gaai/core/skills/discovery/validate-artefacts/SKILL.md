# Validate Artefacts

## Purpose / When to Activate

Activate:
- After generating Epics
- After generating Stories
- Before any Delivery planning or execution

This is the **mandatory gate** between Discovery and Delivery. No Story proceeds to Delivery without passing this check.

---

## Process

### Epic Validation
- Expresses a user outcome (not a feature or technical task)
- Aligns with product direction
- Avoids technical implementation detail
- Clearly scoped with no hidden assumptions

### Story Validation
- Maps to a parent Epic
- Includes measurable acceptance criteria
- Is unambiguous and executable
- Respects governance rules
- Avoids solution design
- Has `related_decs` field in frontmatter (list or explicit empty `[]`)
- Has `skills_invoked` field in frontmatter (must list the skill IDs that were read to produce it)

### Cross-checks
- No Story exists without a parent Epic
- No scope contradictions with memory
- No rule violations
- Marketing artefacts (if present): hypothesis statuses align with Story acceptance criteria
- Strategy artefacts (if present): GTM phases align with Epic dependencies and gates
- **Epic dependency propagation check:** If the parent Epic's `## Dependencies` section lists other Epics, verify that every Story's `depends_on` includes at least one terminal story from each listed Epic. A phasing constraint in Epic prose that is not encoded in story `depends_on` is a **FAIL** — the daemon cannot enforce prose constraints, only `depends_on` fields.

### Skill Attestation (Base Rule #2 Enforcement)
- **Every artefact** (Epic, Story, PRD) must have a `skills_invoked` field in its frontmatter
- Epic artefacts must include `generate-epics` in `skills_invoked`
- Story artefacts must include `generate-stories` in `skills_invoked`
- PRD artefacts must include `create-prd` in `skills_invoked`
- An artefact with a missing or empty `skills_invoked` field is an automatic **FAIL** — the producing agent did not follow Base Rule #2
- This check exists because agents can produce format-correct artefacts from cached knowledge while silently skipping mandatory process steps defined in the skill file

## Outputs

```
Validation Report — Discovery

Epics:
- E01: PASS | FAIL — reason
- E02: PASS | FAIL — reason

Stories:
- S01: PASS | FAIL — reason
- S02: PASS | FAIL — reason

Skill Attestation (Base Rule #2):
- E01: skills_invoked: [generate-epics] ✓ | MISSING ✗
- S01: skills_invoked: [generate-stories] ✓ | MISSING ✗
- S01: related_decs: [DEC-11] ✓ | MISSING ✗

Governance:
- rules respected: yes | no
- missing artefacts: none | list
- risks detected: none | list

Overall Status:
PASS | BLOCKED
```

---

## Blocking Conditions

The skill MUST block progression if:
- Any Story lacks acceptance criteria
- Epics are solution-oriented rather than outcome-oriented
- Scope is unclear or ambiguous
- Governance rules are violated
- Contradictions exist between artefacts
- Any artefact is missing `skills_invoked` in frontmatter (Base Rule #2 violation)
- Any Story is missing `related_decs` in frontmatter

**No partial approval. No silent warnings.**

---

## Non-Goals

This skill must NOT:
- Rewrite artefacts
- Invent missing content
- Make product decisions
- Soften failures

**It validates — it does not fix. If Delivery can misunderstand it, Discovery is not done.**

On BLOCKED verdict: the Discovery Agent must invoke `refine-scope` to resolve the identified gaps, then re-run this skill. Do not proceed to Delivery until the verdict is PASS.
