# Create PRD

## Purpose / When to Activate

Activate when:
- Starting a new product
- Launching a major new initiative
- Facing strategic uncertainty
- Needing strong alignment before Epics begin

Skip when adding small features, tweaking existing flows, or implementing obvious improvements — go directly to Epics & Stories in those cases.

---

## Process

1. Clarify the core user problem before any solution
2. Identify target users (primary and secondary)
3. Define the value hypothesis: if this succeeds, what changes for users?
4. State explicit success metrics
5. Define scope: what is IN and what is OUT
6. Document constraints and assumptions
7. Output a lean PRD using the canonical template

## Output Format

Produces a file at `contexts/artefacts/prd/{name}.prd.md` using `contexts/artefacts/prd/_template.prd.md`:

Key sections:
- Vision
- User Problem
- Target Users
- Value Hypothesis
- Success Metrics
- Scope (in / out)
- Constraints & Assumptions
- Decomposition Path → Epics → Stories

---

## Quality Checks

- Problem is framed before solution
- Value is explicit, not implied
- Scope boundaries are clear
- Success metrics are measurable
- No technical design decisions included

---

## Non-Goals

This skill must NOT:
- Generate Epics or Stories (separate skills)
- Make architectural decisions
- Be invoked for small feature additions

**Always ask WHY before WHAT.**
