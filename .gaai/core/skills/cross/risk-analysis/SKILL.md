# Risk Analysis

## Purpose / When to Activate

Activate:
- Before finalizing Epics & Stories
- Before execution planning
- After repeated QA failures
- After major scope changes

This skill makes risks **explicit, prioritized, and actionable**. It does not solve problems.

---

## Process

**CRITICAL — Anti-Collision Guard (MUST execute before writing any output file):**
Before writing `contexts/artefacts/risk-reports/{story_id}.risk-report.md`, check if the target file already exists on disk:
- If it does NOT exist → proceed normally.
- If it DOES exist → **read the existing file first**. Then decide:
  - If the existing content is from a **different entity** (different story ID, different epic) → **STOP immediately**, surface the ID collision to the human, do not proceed.
  - If the existing content is from the **same entity** and an update is warranted → proceed, but preserve any human edits or prior findings that remain relevant. Treat this as an **update**, not a replacement.
  - If the existing content is identical or still valid → skip writing, report "no changes needed".
This guard prevents the silent data loss incident of 2026-03-17 where concurrent sessions overwrote story files.

1. Read provided artefacts fully
2. Load relevant memory (if supplied)
3. Scan for: ambiguity, assumptions, complexity spikes, constraint conflicts, missing validations
4. For each risk: describe clearly, classify type, assess impact and likelihood, propose mitigation direction (not solution)
5. Rank risks by severity. Derive severity from impact × likelihood using this matrix:
   - **Critical:** high impact + high likelihood, OR any impact + touches security/payments/PII
   - **High:** high impact + medium likelihood, OR medium impact + high likelihood
   - **Medium:** medium impact + medium likelihood, OR high impact + low likelihood
   - **Low:** low impact + any likelihood, OR medium impact + low likelihood

## Risk Categories

**Product risks:** unclear outcomes, wrong user assumptions, missing edge cases, scope creep

**Delivery risks:** technical feasibility, hidden dependencies, performance/security concerns, testability gaps

**Systemic risks:** architectural erosion, rule violations, knowledge loss, repeated failure patterns

---

## Output Format

RISK-ID naming convention: use format `RISK-{STORY_ID}-{NNN}` (e.g., `RISK-E06S18-001`).

Each risk:

```
### RISK-ID

Type: product | delivery | systemic
Description: clear concise risk
Impact: low | medium | high | critical
Likelihood: low | medium | high
Why it matters: concrete consequence
Suggested mitigation direction: what needs clarification, validation or control
```

---

## Quality Checks

- No vague risks ("might be complex" is invalid)
- Each risk is actionable
- Severity is explicit
- No risk inflation
- Focus on real failure points
- Every risk must trace to a specific artefact section, assumption, or identified gap — not a general technical concern

---

## Non-Goals

This skill must NOT:
- Invent risks without evidence
- Propose detailed solutions
- Bypass artefacts
- Produce long lists of low-signal risks

**Unseen risk is what breaks AI-driven delivery. Surfaced risk is what makes it predictable.**
