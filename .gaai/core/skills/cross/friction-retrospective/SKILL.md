# Friction Retrospective

## Purpose / When to Activate

Activate to aggregate and analyze friction captured during delivery. This skill reads `## Friction Log` sections from delivery artefacts and detects patterns that warrant promotion to durable memory (conventions, decisions, rule updates).

**Recommended triggers (conventions, not rules):**
- **Per-Epic:** when an Epic is marked done
- **Monthly:** alongside `memory-refresh`
- **Incident:** if a single Story generates 3+ friction events

**Constraint:** Only the Discovery Agent may invoke this skill. Delivery agents capture friction; Discovery analyzes it.

## Process

1. **Scope resolution** — determine which artefacts to scan:
   - If `epic` filter: scan artefacts matching `{epic_id}S*`
   - If `date_range` filter: scan artefacts within date range (from frontmatter `created_at`)
   - If `type` filter: scan all artefacts but only extract entries matching the specified friction type
   - If no filter: scan all artefacts (full retrospective)

2. **Friction extraction** — for each artefact containing a `## Friction Log`:
   - Parse the table rows
   - Tag each entry with: Story ID (from filename), date (from frontmatter), artefact type (impl-report / qa-report / micro-delivery-report)

3. **Pattern detection** — analyze extracted entries:
   - Group by `type` (ac-ambiguity, missing-context, tool-failure, etc.)
   - Count frequency per type
   - Identify thematic clusters within each type (e.g., multiple `missing-context` about the same domain)
   - Flag all entries with `signal: high`
   - Flag types with frequency ≥ 3

4. **Classify promotion candidates** — for entries meeting promotion threshold:
   - `signal: high` → automatic promotion candidate (CAND-XXX)
   - frequency ≥ 3 for same type+theme → promotion candidate
   - Map each candidate to its promotion target (see Promotion Path below)

5. **Produce the report** — structured in 4 sections:
   - **Pattern Summary:** type distribution, top themes, overall friction density
   - **High-Signal Events (CAND-XXX):** each candidate with evidence, proposed promotion target, and recommended action
   - **Low-Signal Events:** grouped by type, listed for awareness
   - **Retrospective Notes:** observations, cross-cutting themes, questions for human review

6. **Write or return** — if scope is named (epic or date range), write to `contexts/artefacts/retrospectives/{scope}.retro.md`; otherwise return inline

## Promotion Path

| Friction type | Promotion target | Destination file |
|---|---|---|
| `missing-context` (pattern) | New coding pattern | `patterns/conventions.md` |
| `missing-context` (decision) | New decision | `decisions/DEC-{ID}.md` |
| `ac-ambiguity` (recurring) | Story template or Discovery rule | `orchestration.rules.md` or `_template.story.md` |
| `pattern-gap` | New code pattern | `patterns/conventions.md` |
| `rule-conflict` | Rule clarification | `orchestration.rules.md` |
| `tool-failure` (systemic) | Ops note or infra decision | `ops/platform.md` or new DEC |
| `retry-loop` (≥3 same domain) | QA pattern | `patterns/conventions.md` |

**Important:** This skill identifies candidates and recommends actions. Actual promotion to memory is performed by the Discovery Agent using `memory-ingest` — never automatically by this skill.

## Outputs

- Retrospective report with pattern analysis
- Promotion candidates (CAND-XXX) with evidence and recommended targets
- Friction density metrics (events per Story, per type)

---

## Quality Checks

- Every CAND-XXX has at least 2 supporting evidence entries (or 1 with `signal: high`)
- Promotion targets are specific (file path + section), not vague
- Low-signal events are listed but never promoted
- Report does not contain implementation fixes — only identifies what to fix and where

---

## Non-Goals

This skill must NOT:
- Write to memory directly (it produces candidates; Discovery promotes)
- Modify rules, conventions, or decisions
- Re-run or remediate delivery — it is purely analytical
- Assign blame to agents or sub-agents
