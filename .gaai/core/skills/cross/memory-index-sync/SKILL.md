# Memory Index Sync

## Purpose / When to Activate

Activate when:
- `/gaai-status` reports files on disk not registered in `index.md`
- After a batch of DEC files were created outside the `decision-extraction` skill
- As a lightweight post-delivery gate to confirm index integrity
- Before running `memory-refresh` or `memory-compact` (ensures index accuracy first)

This skill **heals drift** — it does NOT create new knowledge. It only registers things that already exist on disk but are missing from `index.md`.

## Process

### Step 1 — Decision Registry Sync

1. Read `index.md` Decision Registry table — extract all registered DEC IDs
2. Glob `decisions/DEC-*.md` — list all files on disk, extract IDs from filenames
3. For each DEC file on disk **not** in the registry:
   - Read its YAML frontmatter: `id`, `domain`, `level`, `title`, `status`, `superseded_by`
   - Add one row to the Decision Registry: `| DEC-{N} | {domain} | {level} | {title} |`
   - If frontmatter `status: superseded` and `superseded_by` is set: append `⚠️ SUPERSEDED by DEC-{M}` to the description column
4. For each registered DEC with **no file on disk**: flag `⚠️ MISSING FILE` in the sync report — do NOT delete registry rows (possible archive situation)

### Step 2 — File Count Update

Re-count all `DEC-*.md` files on disk. Update the Shared Categories table file count in `index.md` to match.

### Step 3 — Summary File Sync

1. Read `index.md` Summaries section — extract registered summary filenames
2. Glob `summaries/*.summary.md` — list all files on disk
3. For each summary on disk **not** registered in `index.md`: read its frontmatter, add entry to Summaries section
4. For each registered summary with **no file on disk**: flag `⚠️ MISSING FILE — update pointer or delete entry` in sync report

### Step 4 — Supersession Reconciliation

1. For each DEC file on disk with `status: superseded` in frontmatter:
   - Check if its registry row carries the `⚠️ SUPERSEDED by DEC-{M}` marker
   - If not: add the marker to the registry row
2. Verify the Superseded/Retracted table in `index.md` is consistent with the Decision Registry (no contradictions)

### Step 5 — Index Frontmatter Update

Update `index.md` frontmatter `updated_at` field:
- Format: `{YYYY-MM-DD} ({N} entries synced, {M} anomalies flagged)` — or `(no drift — confirmed clean)` if nothing changed

## Output: Sync Report (inline, after completion)

```
# Memory Index Sync — {date}

## Changes Applied
- Registered: DEC-{A}, DEC-{B}, ..., DEC-{Z} (10 entries added to registry)
- Supersession markers added: DEC-{X} (→ DEC-{Y})
- File count updated: N → M

## Anomalies Flagged (requires human review)
- ⚠️ MISSING FILE: DEC-{N} registered but no file on disk
- ⚠️ ORPHAN SUMMARY: decisions-80-89.summary.md on disk, not in index

## Result: CLEAN | DRIFT_HEALED | ANOMALIES_FOUND
```

---

## Quality Checks

- Only registers what exists on disk — never invents registry rows
- Never deletes existing registry rows (only flags anomalies)
- Sync report is always produced, even if no changes needed (`CLEAN`)
- Idempotent — running twice produces no additional changes
- Does not modify any file except `index.md`

## Non-Goals

This skill must NOT:
- Create new DEC files (use `decision-extraction`)
- Ingest new knowledge (use `memory-ingest`)
- Compact or archive memory (use `memory-compact` or `memory-refresh`)
- Modify DEC file content

**Memory-index-sync heals the registry. It does not create or delete knowledge.**
