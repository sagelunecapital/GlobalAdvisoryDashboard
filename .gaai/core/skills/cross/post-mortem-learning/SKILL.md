# Post-Mortem Learning

## Purpose / When to Activate

Activate after:
- Significant delivery failures
- Repeated QA failures on the same area
- Delivery that missed its success metrics
- Patterns of issues that need systemic understanding

---

## Process

1. Reconstruct what happened end-to-end
2. Compare expected vs actual outcomes
3. Identify: technical causes, contextual gaps, decision errors, rule weaknesses
4. Produce concrete failure narratives
5. Extract **raw lessons (non-generalized)** — specific to this failure

---

## Outputs

- Root cause analysis report
- Failure timeline
- Mapped rule gaps
- Raw lesson list (specific, not generic)
- Candidate improvement areas (for backlog or rules)

---

## Quality Checks

- Root causes are specific, not generic ("insufficient testing" is invalid — "acceptance criterion #3 had no test coverage" is valid)
- Lessons are raw and specific, not platitudes
- Failure timeline is traceable
- Rule gaps link to specific rule files

---

## Non-Goals

This skill must NOT:
- Propose solutions (produces inputs for backlog and rules, not fixes)
- Assign blame
- Generalize into vague lessons

**Makes failures understandable and actionable. Enables serious continuous improvement.**
