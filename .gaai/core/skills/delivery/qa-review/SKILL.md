# QA Review

## Purpose / When to Activate

Activate after implementation is complete. This is a **hard quality gate**.

**No pass → no delivery.**

---

## Process

### 1. Story Compliance Check
- Parse Story YAML frontmatter
- Extract acceptance criteria
- Validate each criterion is demonstrably satisfied in code
- Any criterion unclear or unmet → FAIL immediately

### 2. Scope Integrity Check
- Only files within Story scope were modified
- No feature creep introduced
- No unrelated refactors included
- Unexpected changes → FAIL

### 3. Rule Enforcement
- Confirm compliance with each applicable rule
- Surface violations explicitly
- Any broken rule → FAIL

### 4. Regression Scan
- Broken tests → FAIL
- Behavior drift → FAIL
- Known risk patterns from memory → FAIL

### 5. Build / Type / Lint Integrity

Test runners that transpile (vitest, jest, ts-jest, swc, esbuild, babel) execute code WITHOUT type checking — a green test suite does not prove the code compiles. Static-type or linter errors in test files, fixtures, and adjacent modules will pass tests locally and only surface at deploy time.

Identify and run the project's full static-analysis gate for every workspace package whose files were modified (directly or via type/dep propagation):
- TypeScript: `tsc --noEmit` (or `pnpm typecheck` / equivalent script)
- For Cloudflare Workers projects: regenerate runtime types first (`wrangler types`) — drift between `worker-configuration.d.ts` and `wrangler.jsonc` masks real errors
- Lint (if the project enforces it as a gate): `eslint`, `ruff`, `clippy`, etc.
- Other ecosystems: `cargo check`, `mypy`, `go vet`, etc.

If the project documents the exact command in `contexts/memory/patterns/conventions.md` or a delivery rules file, use that command verbatim — do not improvise.

Any error → FAIL. "Test files only" is not a mitigation: test files are part of the typecheck graph and break the deploy gate.

### 6. Quality Checks
- Error-prone operations lack error handling → FAIL
- External input enters functions without validation → FAIL
- Identifiers are ambiguous or non-descriptive → FAIL
- A function or module handles more than one responsibility without decomposition → FAIL
- Dead code or unreachable branches present → FAIL
- Tests were disabled or skipped to make the suite pass → FAIL

### 7. Memory Alignment (PASS only)

On PASS verdict, the skill MUST invoke `memory-alignment-check` (SKILL-MEMORY-ALIGNMENT-CHECK-001) before returning. The canonical schema for `{id}.memory-delta.md` is defined authoritatively in `memory-alignment-check/SKILL.md` Outputs section (lines 85–116). QA MUST NOT write or modify `{id}.memory-delta.md` directly — only `memory-alignment-check` writes the delta.

## Outputs

**If PASS:**
```
status: PASS
validated_stories:
  - E01S01
notes:
  - All acceptance criteria satisfied
  - No rule violations
  - No regressions detected
```

**If FAIL:**
```
status: FAIL
blocking_issues:
  - Story E01S01: acceptance criterion #2 not satisfied
  - Rule code-style violated in services/api/user.ts
  - Unexpected file modified: services/payments/
recommended_actions:
  - Fix acceptance behavior
  - Revert out-of-scope change
  - Apply code rule formatting
```

---

## Hard Rules

This skill must NEVER:
- Modify code
- Reinterpret Stories
- Negotiate acceptance criteria
- Approve partial conformance
- MUST NOT write or modify `contexts/artefacts/memory-deltas/{id}.memory-delta.md` directly. The delta is written exclusively by `memory-alignment-check` (invoked at Step 6). Free-form delta variants are a governance violation.

**If it's not explicitly validated → it's broken. If it's broken → it doesn't ship.**
