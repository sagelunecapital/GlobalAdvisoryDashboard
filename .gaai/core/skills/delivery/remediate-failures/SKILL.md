# Remediate Failures

## Purpose / When to Activate

Activate when:
- QA review returns FAIL
- Acceptance criteria are unmet
- Rules are violated
- Regressions are detected
- Implementation deviates from governed artefacts

---

## Process

1. Identify all failures precisely from the QA report
2. Map each failure to: acceptance criteria / rule violated / implementation section
3. Determine minimal corrective changes
4. Apply fixes without expanding scope
5. Re-validate against Story criteria and rules
6. Prepare updated inputs for QA re-run

**Loop: Detect → Correct → Re-validate → repeat until PASS.**

**Convergence / Escalation:** If re-validation does not pass after 3 attempts, or if a fix requires changing acceptance criteria or product intent, STOP. Mark the story as `failed` and escalate to Discovery with a remediation report listing: what was attempted, what failed, and why convergence was not possible.

## Remediation Principles

- Fix the cause, not the symptom
- Minimal change preferred
- Never broaden scope
- Never reinterpret requirements
- Respect architecture constraints
- Preserve maintainability

---

## Output

- Corrected implementation
- Remediation notes:
  - What failed
  - What was fixed
  - Why it now passes
- Updated inputs for QA re-validation

---

## Quality Checks

- All acceptance criteria satisfied
- No rule violations remain
- QA review will pass
- Scope unchanged
- Code remains clean

---

## Non-Goals

This skill must NOT:
- Add new features
- Reinterpret product intent
- Weaken rules
- Bypass quality gates
- Silently ignore failures

**If a fix requires changing product intent or scope: STOP. Escalate back to Discovery. Remediation is correction — not redesign.**
