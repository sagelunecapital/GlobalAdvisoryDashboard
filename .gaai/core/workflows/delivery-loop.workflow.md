# Delivery Loop Workflow

> **Branch model:** The delivery workflow targets the `staging` branch. AI never interacts with `production`. Promotion staging → production is a human action via GitHub PR.

## Purpose

Transform validated Stories into working, tested, governed software through coordinated sub-agent execution.

The Delivery Agent acts as orchestrator. It spawns specialized sub-agents, collects their handoff artefacts, and coordinates phase transitions until every Story either PASSes QA or ESCALATEs to the human.

---

## When to Use

- When Stories are validated and acceptance criteria are complete
- As the primary execution loop for all delivery work
- Invoked per Story or per batch from the active backlog

---

## Agent

**Delivery Agent / Orchestrator** (`agents/delivery.agent.md`)

Sub-agents spawned during execution:
- `agents/sub-agents/micro-delivery.sub-agent.md` (Tier 1)
- `agents/sub-agents/planning.sub-agent.md` (Tier 2/3)
- `agents/sub-agents/implementation.sub-agent.md` (Tier 2/3)
- `agents/sub-agents/qa.sub-agent.md` (Tier 2/3)
- Specialists per `agents/specialists.registry.yaml` (Tier 3 only)

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting the loop:
- ✅ Stories are validated (`validate-artefacts` has PASSED)
- ✅ Acceptance criteria are present and testable
- ✅ Backlog item status is `refined`
- ✅ `agents/specialists.registry.yaml` is present

---

## Workflow Steps

### 0. Git Setup (before any execution)

**CRITICAL INVARIANT: The main working tree stays on `staging` at ALL times.** The daemon polls in the main working tree. Deliveries work in worktrees. All staging operations (pull, merge, push) are serialized via `flock .gaai/project/contexts/backlog/.delivery-locks/.staging.lock`.

### Staging Push Retry Pattern

With `--max-concurrent > 1`, concurrent `git push origin staging` can fail (non-fast-forward). All staging push operations use a retry-with-rebase pattern:

```bash
# Retry pattern: pull --rebase + push, 3 attempts, exponential backoff
for attempt in 1 2 3; do
  git pull --rebase origin staging && git push origin staging && break
  [ $attempt -lt 3 ] && sleep $((attempt * 2))  # backoff: 2s, 4s, 6s
done || { echo "ESCALATE: staging push failed after 3 attempts"; exit 1; }
```

- **3 attempts**, backoff 2s / 4s / 6s
- On exhaustion: **ESCALATE** (do not mark done, do not lose work)
- `flock` serialization still applies (prevents local contention on multi-worktree macOS setups)

For every Story, before any implementation begins:

```bash
# Step 0 — Prerequisites
# Verify remote exists (GAAI requires a configured remote for PR-based delivery)
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || {
  echo "FATAL: no 'origin' remote configured. GAAI requires a remote repository for PR-based delivery."
  echo "Run: git remote add origin <url>"
  exit 1
}

# Resolve worktree path ONCE as absolute — all subsequent operations use $WORKTREE_PATH
REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
WORKTREE_PATH="${GAAI_WORKTREE_BASE:-${REPO_ROOT}/..}/${id}-workspace"

# Step 0a: Sync with latest staging (under flock if concurrent)
flock .gaai/project/contexts/backlog/.delivery-locks/.staging.lock bash -c '
  git pull origin staging
'

# Step 0b: Mark in_progress + push with retry (cross-device coordination)
# If daemon-launched: already done by the daemon. Skip if status is already in_progress.
# If manual launch: the delivery agent does this itself.
flock .gaai/project/contexts/backlog/.delivery-locks/.staging.lock bash -c '
  .gaai/core/scripts/backlog-scheduler.sh --set-status {id} in_progress .gaai/project/contexts/backlog/active.backlog.yaml
  git add .gaai/project/contexts/backlog/active.backlog.yaml
  git commit -m "chore({id}): in_progress [delivery]"
  for attempt in 1 2 3; do
    git pull --rebase origin staging && git push origin staging && break
    [ $attempt -lt 3 ] && sleep $((attempt * 2))
  done || { echo "ESCALATE: staging push failed after 3 attempts"; exit 1; }
'

# Step 0c: Create branch WITHOUT switching (main stays on staging)
git branch story/{id} staging
git worktree add "$WORKTREE_PATH" story/{id}

# Step 0d: Validate worktree exists (mandatory gate — do NOT skip)
if [ ! -e "$WORKTREE_PATH/.git" ]; then
  echo "FATAL: worktree not found at $WORKTREE_PATH — cannot proceed with delivery"
  exit 1
fi
```

All sub-agents operate exclusively inside `$WORKTREE_PATH`. The main working directory stays on `staging` and is never switched. If two Stories run in parallel, each has its own worktree — zero filesystem conflicts. Worktree isolation is **unconditional** regardless of story tier.

Override the default worktree location by setting `GAAI_WORKTREE_BASE` (e.g., `export GAAI_WORKTREE_BASE=/tmp/gaai-worktrees` for cloud-synced repos).

### 1. Select Next Story

Read `.gaai/project/contexts/backlog/active.backlog.yaml`. Select the highest-priority ready Story (status: `refined`, no unresolved dependencies). Use `.gaai/core/scripts/backlog-scheduler.sh --next .gaai/project/contexts/backlog/active.backlog.yaml` for automated selection.

### 2. Evaluate Story

Invoke `evaluate-story` → returns tier (1/2/3), specialists_triggered, risk_analysis_required.

### 2b. Persist Tier Assignment

After evaluate-story completes and **before spawning any sub-agent**, persist the tier on the backlog entry:

```bash
.gaai/core/scripts/backlog-scheduler.sh --set-field {id} tier {1|2|3} \
  .gaai/project/contexts/backlog/active.backlog.yaml
```

The `tier` value is the integer (1, 2, or 3) returned by evaluate-story. This enables delivery telemetry segmentation (cost, duration, retry rate by tier) and future threshold calibration.

### 3. Compose Team

Invoke `compose-team` → assembles context bundles for each sub-agent in the selected tier.

If `risk_analysis_required: true` → invoke `risk-analysis` and add output to Planning Sub-Agent context bundle.

### 4. Execute — Tier 1 (MicroDelivery)

Spawn `micro-delivery.sub-agent.md` with minimal context bundle.

Collect `{id}.micro-delivery-report.md`.

Invoke `coordinate-handoffs`:
- PASS → proceed to step 8
- FAIL (recoverable: test failure, logic bug) → retry once; if second attempt fails → complexity-escalation to Tier 2
- FAIL (structural: AC ambiguous, context gap, rule conflict) → ESCALATE immediately, no retry
- ESCALATE → stop, surface to human + invoke `post-mortem-learning`
- complexity-escalation → re-evaluate as Tier 2, proceed to step 5

### 5. Execute — Tier 2/3: Planning Phase

Spawn `planning.sub-agent.md` with Planning context bundle.

Collect `{id}.execution-plan.md`.

Invoke `coordinate-handoffs` → validate artefact → PROCEED or RE-SPAWN or ESCALATE.

### 6. Execute — Tier 2/3: Implementation Phase

Spawn `implementation.sub-agent.md` with Implementation context bundle.

For Tier 3: Implementation Sub-Agent spawns Specialists per registry triggers.

Collect `{id}.impl-report.md`.

Invoke `coordinate-handoffs` → validate artefact → PROCEED or RE-SPAWN or ESCALATE.

**After PROCEED — atomic commit:**
```bash
git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" add .
git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" commit -m "feat({id}): {Story title summary}

Implements: {AC list e.g. AC1–AC9}
Story: contexts/artefacts/stories/{id}.story.md

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### 7. Execute — Tier 2/3: QA Phase

Spawn `qa.sub-agent.md` with QA context bundle.

Collect `{id}.qa-report.md`.

Invoke `coordinate-handoffs`:
- PASS → proceed to step 8
- FAIL → re-spawn Implementation Sub-Agent with qa-report, then re-spawn QA Sub-Agent (max 3 cycles — see `qa.sub-agent.md`)
- ESCALATE → stop, surface to human

### 7b. Commit Delivery Artefacts to Story Branch

After QA PASS, commit all delivery artefacts (execution-plan, impl-report, qa-report, memory-delta) to the story branch in the worktree. This ensures artefacts flow to staging via the PR merge — never pushed directly to staging.

```bash
# Step 7b: Commit delivery artefacts to story branch (in worktree)
git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" add .gaai/project/contexts/artefacts/
git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" commit -m "docs({id}): delivery artefacts — plan, impl-report, qa-report, memory-delta"
```

### 7c. Diff-Scope Sanity Check (MANDATORY)

**Before pushing, verify the diff is consistent with the Story scope.** This is a safety heuristic to catch corrupted trees, accidental `git add .` on wrong directories, or GIT_DIR contamination from hooks. It is NOT a hard limit on story size.

```bash
# Count files changed vs staging baseline
DIFF_STAT=$(git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" diff --stat staging..HEAD)
CHANGED_FILES=$(git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" diff --name-only staging..HEAD)
CHANGED_COUNT=$(echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
DELETED_COUNT=$(git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" diff --diff-filter=D --name-only staging..HEAD | wc -l)

echo "Diff-scope check: $CHANGED_COUNT files changed, $DELETED_COUNT deleted"

NON_GAAI_DELETIONS=$(git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" diff --diff-filter=D --name-only staging..HEAD \
  | grep -vcE '^\.gaai/' || true)
```

#### Hard escalation triggers (always STOP — no reviewer)

These are mechanical signals of tree corruption. No judgment needed.

```bash
# Non-.gaai file deletions → possible tree corruption
if [ "$NON_GAAI_DELETIONS" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "ESCALATE: $NON_GAAI_DELETIONS non-.gaai deletions — possible tree corruption"
  echo "$DIFF_STAT"
  # Push story branch to preserve work before stopping
  git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" push origin "story/{id}" 2>/dev/null || true
  exit 1  # Do NOT merge. ESCALATE to human.
fi
```

#### Soft threshold (> 30 files) — sub-agent reviewer decides

When the diff exceeds 30 files, the Delivery Agent MUST NOT decide alone whether to proceed. Instead, **spawn a sub-agent reviewer** to evaluate whether the diff is consistent with the Story scope. The Delivery Agent is the generator — it cannot be the sole evaluator of its own output (base.rules.md Rule 5).

```
Reviewer input:
  - Story title + Acceptance Criteria (from the story artefact)
  - CHANGED_FILES list (full paths, one per line)
  - CHANGED_COUNT

Reviewer task:
  "This delivery changed {CHANGED_COUNT} files (exceeds the 30-file soft threshold).
   Determine whether ALL changed files are traceable to the Story's scope.

   Story: {title}
   ACs: {acceptance criteria}

   Changed files:
   {CHANGED_FILES}

   Answer with a structured verdict:
   - PROCEED: every file is within the Story's domain — the count is high but
     explainable (e.g., test-rewrite story touching many test files).
   - ESCALATE: one or more files are outside the Story's expected scope, OR the
     changes span unrelated modules, OR you cannot confidently trace all files
     to the ACs.

   Be conservative: when in doubt, ESCALATE."
```

**Decision flow:**

```
CHANGED_COUNT > 30
  → spawn sub-agent reviewer (isolated context, no conversation history)
    → reviewer says PROCEED → continue to Step 8 (push + PR + merge)
    → reviewer says ESCALATE → push story branch to preserve work, then exit 1
```

**Important:** The reviewer runs in an **isolated context window** — it receives only the Story ACs and the file list, NOT the Delivery Agent's self-assessment or conversation history. This prevents confirmation bias (base.rules.md Rule 5).

If the reviewer is unavailable (sub-agent spawn fails), treat as ESCALATE — fail safe.

### 8. Create PR & Complete Story

**8a. Push story branch and create PR to staging:**

```bash
# Push story branch to origin
git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" push origin story/{id}

# Create PR targeting staging
gh pr create --base staging --head story/{id} \
  --title "feat({id}): {Story title}" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

## Test Results
- Tests: {X}/{X} pass
- TSC: clean
- QA Verdict: PASS

## Changes Delivered
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
{table from impl-report}

## Story
- ID: {id}

# Returns: CI PASS | CI PASS (advisory) | CI FAIL
# CI PASS (advisory) = CI failed but no branch protection → merge anyway

**8b. Delivery artefacts:** Delivery artefacts are committed to the story branch before PR creation (step 7b) and merge to staging via the PR. No separate staging push needed.

**8c. Mark Story done + cleanup worktree:**

```bash
# Remove worktree (but keep story branch — needed for the PR)
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH"

# Update backlog (push with retry-rebase pattern)
flock .gaai/project/contexts/backlog/.delivery-locks/.staging.lock bash -c '
  git pull origin staging
  .gaai/core/scripts/backlog-scheduler.sh --set-status {id} done .gaai/project/contexts/backlog/active.backlog.yaml
  git add .gaai/project/contexts/backlog/active.backlog.yaml
  git commit -m "chore({id}): done [delivery]"
  for attempt in 1 2 3; do
    git pull --rebase origin staging && git push origin staging && break
    [ $attempt -lt 3 ] && sleep $((attempt * 2))
  done || { echo "ESCALATE: staging push failed after 3 attempts"; exit 1; }
'
```

> **Note:** The story branch is NOT deleted. It stays on origin for the PR. GitHub can auto-delete branches after PR merge (configure in repo Settings → General → "Automatically delete head branches").

Move completed Story to `contexts/backlog/done/{YYYY-MM}.done.yaml`.

Invoke `decision-extraction` if notable architectural or governance decisions emerged.

Flag any new patterns worth persisting as a memory-delta artefact (`memory-deltas/{id}.memory-delta.md`) for Discovery to review and ingest in the next session. Delivery does not invoke `memory-ingest` directly — see `orchestration.rules.md` §Memory Ingestion.

**If the Story required human intervention or reached 3 QA cycles:** invoke `post-mortem-learning`. Record the friction signal (domain, root cause hypothesis, AC gap if applicable) as a `[FRICTION]` entry in `contexts/memory/decisions.memory.md`. This informs future Discovery refinement.

**STOP — report to human:**

```
✅ PR created for review: {PR_URL}

Story: {id} — {Story title}
QA: PASS ({X}/{X} tests, tsc clean)

Next: review and merge the PR on GitHub.
```

**8d. On PR creation failure:**

If `gh pr create` fails (e.g., branch conflict, auth issue):
- Log the error
- Do NOT update backlog to done
- ESCALATE to human with the error details

---

## Sub-Agent Lifecycle (Invariant)

Every sub-agent follows: `SPAWN (with context bundle) → EXECUTE (autonomous) → HANDOFF (artefact to known path) → DIE (context released)`. The Orchestrator only acts after a sub-agent has terminated and its artefact has been collected.

---

## Stop Conditions

**Recoverable failures** — retry is authorized (up to the cycle limits above):
- Test failure with a clear root cause
- Logic bug with a deterministic fix
- Missing file or dependency that can be created within Story scope

**Structural failures** — ESCALATE immediately, no retry:
- Acceptance criteria are ambiguous or contradictory
- A fix would require changing product scope or intent
- A rule violation has no compliant resolution path
- Missing context that cannot be inferred from the Story or memory
- The same failure pattern recurs across retry cycles (loop detected)

The Delivery Orchestrator MUST escalate on any structural failure regardless of remaining retry budget.
