# .gaai/core/ — GAAI Framework Engine

## 4 Commands to Run Your AI-Assisted SDLC

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/gaai-bootstrap` | Initialize project context on an existing codebase |
| `/gaai-discover` | Activate Discovery Agent — clarify intent, create Stories |
| `/gaai-deliver` | Deliver the next refined Story in the current session (interactive or headless) |
| `/gaai-daemon` | Start the Delivery Daemon — polls backlog, delivers Stories autonomously via tmux |
| `/gaai-status` | Show backlog and memory state |

`/gaai-deliver` delivers a single Story in the current context. `/gaai-daemon` launches a background daemon that polls the backlog and delivers multiple Stories in parallel (each in its own tmux session).

Discovery works with any AI coding tool or MCP client (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and more). The daemon requires the Claude Code CLI (`claude` binary in PATH) as a runtime dependency — not a preference. See `compat/COMPAT.md` for the full 3-tier compatibility model.

That's the day-1 surface area. Everything else (47 skills, 8 rule files, 4 workflows) is loaded on demand — you never interact with it directly.

**Information preservation:** When Discovery delegates work to sub-agents, it compiles a *Discovery Session Brief* — a structured extraction of all conversation intelligence (decisions, observations, trade-offs, constraints). This prevents context loss between agents. See [`agents/discovery.agent.md`](agents/discovery.agent.md).

`core/` contains the framework engine: agents, skills, rules, and workflows. These files are shared across all GAAI-powered projects and are managed by the installer. **Do not edit files in `core/` directly** — your changes will be overwritten the next time you update GAAI.

To update the framework, run the installer with the new version:

```bash
bash /tmp/gaai/install.sh --target . --tool claude-code --yes
```

Customization lives in `project/` — add your rules, skills, agents, and memory there.

```
.gaai/
├── core/      ← Framework engine (managed by installer — do not edit)
└── project/   ← Your customizations: memory, backlog, skills, rules
```

## Delivery Daemon

If your project uses git with a `staging` branch, the **Delivery Daemon** delivers refined Stories autonomously:

1. One-time setup: `bash .gaai/core/scripts/daemon-setup.sh`
2. `/gaai-daemon` — starts the daemon (default: 3 slots, auto-opens monitoring)
3. `/gaai-daemon --stop` — graceful shutdown

Override concurrency: `/gaai-daemon --max-concurrent 5`

The daemon polls for `refined` stories and delivers them in parallel via tmux — each delivery runs in its own tmux session with real-time visibility.
Full reference: see `GAAI.md` → "Branch Model & Automation".

**Runtime requirement:** The daemon requires the Claude Code CLI (`claude` binary in PATH). This is a hard dependency — not a recommendation. Discovery and manual Delivery work with any AI coding tool; this requirement applies only to autonomous delivery.

> **Tested on:** macOS (Apple Silicon). Linux and WSL (Windows) are expected to work but not yet validated — issues and feedback welcome.
